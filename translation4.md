In the tenth year when the Greeks were not able to capture Troy, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. In this time Menelaus, Ulixes, Thessander, Stheneleus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus were being collected. And on the horse they wrote that "they give the gift for the Greek Minera", and they carry over the military camps to Tenedos. When the Trojans saw this, the enemies had been judged to have gone away; Priamus ordered that the horse be led into the temple of Minera. When the prophet, Cassandra, was saying that the enemies have the horse, faith was not given to her and they placed the horse in front of the temple. The Greeks went out and they killed the guards of the gate and they conquered Troy.
