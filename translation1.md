C. Chaos was the first of the gods. His daughters, Nox and Terra, were the mother of all humans. This was the mother of Death and Destruction. Those sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cylcopes. Typhon and Python were immense dragons and Cyclopes of foolish stoneworkers. But of them was brother Uranus, the very first king of the gods. This was brave and great, but wise.
