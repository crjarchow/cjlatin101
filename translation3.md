C. Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four children. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but this was conquered. Neptune, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "The daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed". therefore, Cthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrified. The remaining sisters themselves were killed; Erechtheus himself was striked by lightning.
